### PROJECT 2
### MERGE SORT 

## List: [16,21,11,8,12,22]

# Step 1:
Divide list into 2 part: [16,21,11] and [8,12,22]

# Step 2:
Recursively sort them:
[16,21,11] is [11,16,21] after sorting.
[8,12,22] is [8,12,22] after sorting. (It is already sorted.)

# Step 3:
Add 2 list each other:
Final list: [8,11,12,16,21,22]

List is sorted.
